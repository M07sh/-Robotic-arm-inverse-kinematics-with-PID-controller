# -Robotic-arm-inverse-kinematics-with-PID-controller
This project is similar to https://github.com/M07sh/Robotic-arm-forward-kinematics-with-PID-controller project, but with inverse kinematics instead of forward. Inverse Lagrangian Equation was used in the project. In other words, the robotic arm will Determine the joint angle when already have a desired end effector position.
